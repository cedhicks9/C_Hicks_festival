# Project Overview

### This website is created to promote awareness and  generate donations for people who have food security issues in the Bay Area. This will be accomplished through a festival that is being held in early December. This festival will have Three days of activities. On day one  There will be a carnival to target families. On day two there will be a jazz concert a poetry slam and and art auction targeting those 35 and up. On the final day there will be speeches by community leaders and a hip-hop concert targeting 18 and over. There will be food trucks for all the events and all the proceeds will go to the peoples program of Oakland specifically to help fund the free breakfast program  and Bi monthly free grocery program. The reason for the festival is there are 870,000 people in the bay area that are food insecure and food is a human right not a luxury so no one should go without  being able to have food. This festival is looking to engage the community so, it will be held at Lake Merritt in Oakland California.
