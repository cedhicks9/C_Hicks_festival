# Project Overview

This website is created to promote awareness and generate donations for people who have food security issues in the Bay Area. This will be accomplished through a festival that is being held in early December. This festival will have Three days of activities. On day one  There will be a carnival to target families. On day two there will be a jazz concert, a poetry slam and an art auction targeting those 35 and up. On the final day there will be speeches by community leaders and a hip-hop concert focused on the 18 and over demographic. There will be food trucks for all the events and all the proceeds will go to the peoples program of Oakland. Specifically this will help fund the free breakfast program  and Bi monthly free grocery program. The reason for the festival is there are 870,000 people in the bay area that are food insecure and food is a human right not a luxury. No one should go without being able to have food. This festival is looking to engage the community so it will be held at Lake Merritt in Oakland, California.The festival is designed to bring the community together in a fun way in order to bring awareness to the people who are suffering with food insecurity. The festival will be able to generate donations in a way a drive may not be able to because many people are struggling and they may not see themselves with expendable money to give away. The people will have a return on the money they spend beyond the feeling a person gets when they help someone.
